Unofficial documentation for HSL, the behind-the-scenes coding language used for Hamilton Automation Liquid Handling Robots. 

Warning: As any Hamilton employee will tell you, HSL is not really a supported software, and they won't be able to offer you much/any help. This is aimed at being a useful resource for people (like myself) who delve into it despite their warnings.
